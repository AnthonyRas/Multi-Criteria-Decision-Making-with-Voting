# Multi-Criteria-Decision-Making-with-Voting
A multi-criteria decision problem is represented as follows: Each alternative has a set of attributes by which they are compared, and each attribute has a numerical weighting indicating its importance. The alternatives are ranked according to each attribute, and the Schwartz set of the resulting 'election' is computed to determine a set of good decisions.
